INSTALLATION: 

Steps:  1. Go to this location: \update\update.rpf\dlc_patch.
2. Then you must create a folder and call it gt86.
3. Then in that folder you must place the content.xml file inside.
4. Once that is done you then need to go to this location: \update\x64\dlcpacks.
5. Then create another folder called gt86.
6. And finally place the dlc.rpf file inside.

That's it all done!!

Oh before i forget, to make sure the right texture shows up on the side skirt you must place the vehshare.ytd file here:\x64e.rpf\levels\gta5\vehicles.rpf\
