If you haven't already heard i have a website which reviews car and script mods but it also has my own mod including this one shared on the site. This mod and others will no longer be updated and uploaded to gta5-mods.com instead the updates will be posted through my site on this page: http://gta-v-mod-reviews.com/personal-mods.html




I'm also very determined to make the site work out so i can earn real money and quit my full time job so i can make money and actually do it in a way i like so if you could help me get the word out then I'd very much appreciate it.


Thank you
